# My Project Document

## Introduction

This document is part of the "Communicate using Markdown" course. In this step, I'm learning how to add headers to organize the content.

## Key Sections

Here are the main sections of this document. I'm using an `<h2>` for this, and will use an `<h3>` for the subsections.

### Section 1: Planning
This is where the planning details will go.

### Section 2: Development
This section will cover the development phase.

## Image Sample

Here is how you embed an image in Markdown. The text in the square brackets is the alternative text for accessibility.

## Code Sample

You can create a fenced code block by using three backticks. You can also specify the language for syntax highlighting.

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  // This function logs a greeting to the console.
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
